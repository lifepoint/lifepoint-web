**Women's bible studies: Wednesdays 9:00am & 6:30pm**

Join us as we gather together as women.

- To worship the Lord
- To grow in knowledge and practical application of the word of God
- To grow in our personal relationships with the Lord
- To fellowship and grow together as sisters

As we do these things we will be strengthened and built up in our faith so that we can go back into our homes, workplaces and community, equipped to be an influence for the Lord Jesus.
