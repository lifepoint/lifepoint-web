Our youth ministry exists to help students from 6th to 12th grade connect with God and each other. We love to have fun, build relationships, and grow closer to God together. We have fun experiences throughout the year such as summer camp, winter retreat, group games, and so much more where students can enjoy spending time with others their age in a safe environment. 

We also meet weekly in separate junior high and high school groups to study Godâ€™s word and discover his purpose for our lives. During this time, we also play games, eat snacks, and worship God. 
Here are our weekly meeting times:
