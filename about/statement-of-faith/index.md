### Statement of Faith

- WE BELIEVE in one God as three persons: the Father, Jesus Christ the Son, and the Holy Spirit as co-existent, co-eternal, and unified in will.
- WE BELIEVE in the Divine inspiration, reliability, and authority of the Holy Scriptures, as found in the Old and New Testaments, as the foundation and rule for Christian faith, doctrine, and conduct.
- WE BELIEVE all men are sinners, in their unrepentant state destined for Hell and in need of faith in the Savior Jesus Christ for forgiveness of sin and eternal life.
- WE BELIEVE in the Virgin Birth, crucifixion, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, who died for manâ€™s sin and purchased for him eternal life in Heaven.
- WE BELIEVE that man must repent of sin and receive Jesus Christ by faith to be saved.
- WE BELIEVE   in the present ministry of the Holy Spirit, by whose indwelling the Christian is enabled to live a godly life.  We further believe His power and gifts are available to believers today.
- WE BELIEVE in the priesthood of all believers, the unity of the Body of Christ, and the equipping of the saints for the work of ministry.
- WE BELIEVE that the Lord Jesus will return, the dead will be raised and the final judgment will take place, with believers entering into eternal life in Heaven and unbelievers entering into eternal Hell.
