LifePoint church family,

As a result of the recent developments surrounding the progress of COVID-19 (coronavirus), we are taking several steps to ensure the safety and the health of our congregation. At this point we are still offering services on Sunday and during the week. But if you are uncomfortable coming, please don't feel like you have to.

STEPS WE ARE TAKING:
1.  We will not be providing any donuts, just coffee.
2.  Hand sanitizer and wipes will be placed at the front entrance.
3.  The facilities will be sanitized and deep cleaned on an ongoing basis.
4.  As always, we want the church family to be friendly and considerate to those that we meet during our "greeting time".  With that being said, please do not assume that a handshake or a friendly hug is an appropriate greeting during this season.

As a church family, we know that God is in full control. Even though it is tempting to be fearful of what is unknown, we know that our God is a mighty fortress and has steadfast love for the world.

In His grip,
LifePoint Leadership
