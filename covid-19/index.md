Dear LifePoint Church family,

In light of President Trump’s and Stanislaus Health Services Agency’s recommendations for faith-based organizations, LifePoint has decided to postpone Sunday and mid-week services for the next two weeks. With much prayer and reflection, the decision was made not based on fear but on being a responsible member of our community.  It is our desire to support the efforts of the healthcare professionals in controlling the potential spread of this virus.

Philippians 4:6-7: Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.

As we gather as individual families during these next few weeks, please pray for our elderly, our country’s leadership, healthcare professionals, first responders and small businesses.

If you have any questions or concerns, please call Pastor Steve at (209)499-3836. We will keep you updated.

In His grip,

LifePoint Leadership
